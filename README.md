Adds a Style to BigWigs called RehokUI and is based on Mono UI but more pixel perfect based.

Changes from Mono UI to Rehok UI:

Icons now have a 1 pixel border around them instead of a border with a backdrop gap
Text is now more near the edges of the bars
Mono UI has a white backdrop in the bar, This is removed
